# FirstRepository of Friday Projects

This is a repository for the first three friday projects we did, but this time we used AI to generate the code
for us.

The First project that was generated using AI is a game involving madlibs. The user is asked to provide words
that will then be used to fill in blanks that the program will put in. At the end of asking the user for inputs,
it will display all of the inputs in a story for the user to read.

# Print introduction to the adlib game
# Ask user about their favorite color
# Ask user about their favorite food
# Ask user about their favorite animal
# Ask user about their favorite movie
# Ask user about their favorite book
# Ask user about their favorite hobby
# Ask user about their favorite place
# Display the completed adlib story using user responses

The second project that was generated using AI is a code that generates 6 total numbers for the user that act as
"Powerball" numbers. The first 5 need to be a random number between 1 through 69, while the last number is 
a random number between 1 and 26. The program will display the Powerball numbers for the user.

# Main loop to ask the user if they want to play
# Exit the loop if the user doesn't want to play
# Display a message to the user
# Generate and display five random numbers with delays
# Use end=" " to keep numbers on the same line
# Add a delay of 1 second
# Generate and display the Powerball number with a longer delay and four spaces
# Add a longer delay of 2 seconds
# Ask if the user wants to play again
# Exit the loop if the user doesn't want to play again

The third project that was AI generated is a quizbowl, a program that asks the user to answer a few questions with varying answer e.g. the user will be given multiple choice questions, True or False, short answer, and answer where the answer is numeric.

# Define the questions using a dictionary
# Display the game title
# Initialize the counter for correct answers
# Iterate through the questions
# Display a separator line between questions
# Ask user for input based on question type
# Convert to lowercase for case-insensitivity
# Convert to uppercase for case-insensitivity
# Case-insensitive comparison
# Check if the user's answer is correct
# Display a separator line at the end of the quiz
# Display the total number of correct answers
