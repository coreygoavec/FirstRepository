# FirstRepository of Friday Projects

This is a repository for the first three friday projects we did, but this time we used AI to generate the code
for us.

The First project that was generated using AI is a game involving madlibs. The user is asked to provide words
that will then be used to fill in blanks that the program will put in. At the end of asking the user for inputs,
it will display all of the inputs in a story for the user to read.

The second project that was generated using AI is a code that generates 6 total numbers for the user that act as
"Powerball" numbers. The first 5 need to be a random number between 1 through 69, while the last number is 
a random number between 1 and 26. The program will display the Powerball numbers for the user.

The third project that was AI generated is a quizbowl, a program that asks the user to answer a few questions with varying answer e.g. the user will be given multiple choice questions, True or False, short answer, and answer where the answer is numeric.
